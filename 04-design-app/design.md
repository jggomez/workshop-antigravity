### Software Architecture: AI-Powered Document Insight Manager

This technical specification defines the structure of a **Serverless BaaS** application based on **Client-Side Clean Architecture**, utilizing HTML and Tailwind CSS.

---

### Quality Attributes (ISO/IEC 25010)

The following attributes are the pillars ensuring the system is production-grade and not just a prototype.

1.  **Security (Confidentiality):** Strict protection of PDF documents and insights, ensuring only the authenticated owner can access their data.
2.  **Performance Efficiency (Time Behavior):** Minimizing interface load latency and providing immediate feedback during document analysis.
3.  **Reliability (Recoverability):** System capacity to handle AI API failures or network interruptions without data loss.
4.  **Maintainability (Modularity):** A structure that allows switching service providers (e.g., swapping Gemini for another model) without rewriting core business logic.
5.  **Scalability:** Ability to process multiple simultaneous uploads without service degradation.

### 🚩 ASRs (Architecturally Significant Requirements)

Key requirements that shape the most critical technical decisions.

#### **ASR-01: Identity & Data Privacy (Security)**
* **Context:** Users upload sensitive PDF documents. These files and their derived insights must remain private and accessible only by the document owner.
* **Solution:** Integrate **Firebase Auth** using Google Sign-In for identity. Implement **Firestore and Storage Security Rules** that validate the `request.auth.uid` against the `userid` field in each document.
* **Justification:** Moving authorization to the infrastructure layer ensures that data cannot be leaked even if the client-side code is compromised.
* **Pros:** Robust security, zero backend code to maintain, and seamless integration with Google’s ecosystem.
* **Cons:** Tight coupling with Firebase's proprietary security rule language.

#### **ASR-02: Automated Analysis Workflow (Reliability)**
* **Context:** Extracting insights via LLM is an expensive and potentially slow process that may fail due to API timeouts or malformed PDFs.
* **Solution:** Utilize the **Firebase AI Logic Extension** configured with `gemini-3-flash-preview`. The UI observes a status field in Firestore to provide real-time feedback.
* **Justification:** An event-driven approach offloads heavy processing from the user's browser, allowing for managed retries and background execution.
* **Pros:** Scalable, asynchronous execution, and built-in retry logic.
* **Cons:** Potential "cold start" latency for initial cloud function triggers.

#### **ASR-03: Responsive "Vibe" & Interaction (Performance)**
* **Context:** Users require a fluid experience when navigating history or editing insights.
* **Solution:** Use **HTML5/Tailwind CSS** for a lightweight UI and **Firestore Real-time Listeners** for state synchronization.
* **Justification:** Eliminating heavy JavaScript frameworks reduces the bundle size and improves Time-to-Interactive (TTI), while Firestore provides immediate "optimistic" updates.
* **Pros:** Near-instant load times, offline support, and a highly responsive UI.
* **Cons:** Requires manual DOM manipulation or a lightweight reactivity library to manage state in pure HTML.

#### **ASR-04: Error Handling & Observability (Reliability)**
* **Context:** Without a custom backend, errors in AI extraction or storage must be visible to the user to avoid "silent failures."
* **Solution:** Implement an **Audit Log** collection in Firestore where the AI Extension writes execution status and errors.
* **Justification:** Provides a shared log between the agent and the developer to debug failed extractions and maintain system health.
* **Pros:** Improved troubleshooting and clear feedback for the end-user.
* **Cons:** Small increase in Firestore write operations.

#### **ASR-05: Integrity of Extracted Insights (Functional Suitability)**
* **Context:** AI-generated insights can be "hallucinated" or malformed, potentially breaking the UI structure.
* **Solution:** Implement a **Schema Validation** tactic in the "Human-in-the-Loop" review phase.
* **Justification:** Ensures that all saved insights adhere to a strict structure before being persisted, preventing technical debt in the data layer.
* **Pros:** Guaranteed data consistency and simplified frontend rendering.
* **Cons:** Slight increase in client-side processing logic.

### Architectural Patterns

Structural decisions to organize the system and solve domain problems.

* **Clean Architecture (Client-Side):** Layered organization (Entities, Use Cases, Adapters) within the frontend. This isolates business rules from changes in Firebase SDKs.
* **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Elimination of custom servers. All infrastructure is managed by Firebase, reducing operational complexity.
* **Repository Pattern:** Abstraction of Firestore and Storage calls. This ensures application logic does not depend directly on database implementation.
* **Observer Pattern (Real-time):** Utilization of Firestore listeners so the interface updates automatically as soon as the AI writes results to the database.

### Architectural Tactics

Specific technical actions to satisfy Quality Attributes and ASRs.

1.  **Authentication & Authorization (Security):**
    * Use of **Firebase Auth (Gmail)** for identity management.
    * Implementation of **Security Rules** in Firestore/Storage: `allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userid`.

2.  **Asynchronous Calls (Performance):**
    * Use of **Promises and Async/Await** to avoid blocking the main thread.
    * **Optimistic UI Tactic**: The interface reflects changes before the database confirms the write operation.

3.  **Serverless (Scalability & Availability):**
    * Use of **Firebase AI Logic Extension** to automatically scale PDF processing horizontally.
    * Deployment on a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** to ensure global availability and low latency.

### Technical Stack

A selection of tools optimized for development speed and execution performance.

* **Frontend:** Pure HTML5 and **Tailwind CSS v3+** (via CDN or JIT).
* **Client Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) following Clean Architecture structure.
* **Authentication:** **Firebase Auth** (Google Provider).
* **Database:** **Cloud Firestore** (Real-time NoSQL).
* **Storage:** **Firebase Storage** (For PDF files).
* **AI Engine:** **Firebase AI Logic Extension** with the **gemini-3-flash-preview** model.
